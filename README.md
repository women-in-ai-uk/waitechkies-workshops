# WAITechkies Workshops

At Women in AI (WAI), we empower women and minorities to become AI & Data experts, innovators and leaders. We encourage ethical applications and responsible use of artificial intelligence.

The __WAITechkies__ series is designed to help participants gain hands-on skills in high-demand tools and technologies such as GenAI, Python, Power BI, Tableau, AWS, and more. Each session is structured to tackle real-world use cases and ensures attendees can immediately apply and leverage their learning professionally.
